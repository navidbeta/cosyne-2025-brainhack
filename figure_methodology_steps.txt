# Figure Methodology Steps for Reproduction

## Figure 1

**Caption:** Prior knowledge facilitates

**Methodology Steps:**

To recreate Figure 1 from the research paper, the following methodology steps are needed:

1. **Experimental Design and Data Collection**:
   - Use five rats trained in a spatial memory task requiring hippocampal-prefrontal interactions.
   - Implement a continuous alternation W-maze task where rats return to the center from either the right or left side of a W-track and choose the opposite side.
   - Ensure rats are food-deprived and naive to the W-mazes and experimental room.
   - Reward rats for performing the continuous alternation task.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Ensure that the rats are able to remember and discriminate between the familiar and novel environments.
   - Analyze the behavioral data of three additional rats from a previous experiment to confirm the ability to discriminate between environments.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze the firing patterns of prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons to distinguish between the two task sequences critical for performance (IN R-OUT L vs. IN L-OUT R).
   - Generalize responses across the two inbound (IN) and outbound (OUT) trajectories covering distinct spatial locations within a task sequence.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Use statistical methods to determine if prior knowledge facilitates learning in a novel environment.
   - Compare the discriminability of rats from the familiar and novel environments.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Create the graphical representation of the experimental design and results, as shown in Figure 1 of the paper.

In summary, to recreate Figure 1, researchers need to conduct experiments with rats in a spatial memory task, preprocess the data to ensure discrimination between environments, analyze PFC neuron firing patterns, perform statistical analysis, and visualize the results to show how prior knowledge facilitates learning in a novel environment.
